## Scriba
Contemporaneous note tool designed for storing a complete log of dated notes separated by case.

## Running
Scriba does not require any additional files or software other than python 2.7. The script is fully independant and all note logs are stored within the working directory.

python 2.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage
This tool was developed for creating permant notes, therefore it cannot delete existing notes or or modify entries.

## Planned Changes
* Automated back-up to local and/or remote locations
* Built-in integrity checks to prevent corruption to notes
* Ability to mark entries as removed. N.B. Entry will still exist and be displayed with a distinct marker
* Additonal error handling
* Improved interface
